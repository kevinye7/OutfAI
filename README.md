# OutfAI

**Wardrobe-first outfit intelligence.** OutfAI helps you decide what to wear by generating context-aware outfits from your own closet—using mood and weather—with optional, explainable suggestions for new pieces that fit what you already own.

---

## Features

- **Wardrobe-first** — Your closet is the system of record; recommendations start from what you own.
- **Context-aware** — Outfits consider mood, weather, and occasion.
- **Explainable** — Recommendations are transparent and trustworthy, not black-box.
- **Optional commerce** — Suggested purchases justify how they fit your existing wardrobe.

*Currently in MVP: UI and project scaffold are in place; recommendation engine and backend integrations are planned.*
