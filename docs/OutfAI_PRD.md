# OutfAI — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** OutfAI  
**Category:** AI-assisted wardrobe & outfit planning  
**Stage:** Capstone MVP → Startup-viable MVP  
**Primary Platform:** Web (React / TypeScript)  
**Secondary (future):** Mobile (React Native / Expo)

### One-line Value Proposition
OutfAI helps users decide what to wear by generating **context-aware outfits from their own wardrobe**, using mood and weather, while **optionally suggesting new pieces that actually fit what they already own**.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

People experience **decision fatigue** when choosing outfits, even though they already own enough clothing. This problem is intensified by:
- Large, underutilized wardrobes  
- Changing daily context (mood, weather, occasion)  
- Poor mental visibility of how pieces combine  

Existing fashion apps often:
- Push shopping first  
- Require heavy manual setup  
- Offer opaque or unexplainable recommendations  
- Treat the user’s closet as secondary to catalogs  

OutfAI is designed to solve this by being **wardrobe-first**, explainable, and context-aware.

## 3. Target Users

### Primary Personas

- Need fast, low-effort outfit decisions  
- Budget-conscious

**Busy Professionals**
- Care about weather, dress codes, reliability  
- Want repeatable “safe” outfits  
- Value time saved  

**Fashion-Interested but Overwhelmed Users**
- Own many clothes but feel they “have nothing to wear”  
- Want inspiration without overconsumption  

---

## 4. Product Strategy (Research-Informed)

**Positioning:**  
> Wardrobe-first intelligence with optional, context-aware commerce

Principles:
- The user’s closet is the system of record
